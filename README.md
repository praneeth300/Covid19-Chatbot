# Covid19-Chatbot
Many of the questions patients have about Covid-19 are questions that other patients have as well, like What are symptoms of Covid-19? or What should I do if I fear I have been exposed? or Where can I get tested? While each patient has a unique medical history, many of these questions lend themselves to standardized answers that should reflect the most up-to-date knowledge and guidelines about the virus and be readily accessible for patients.  Across a wide range of industries, chatbots have been an efficiency-enhancing way for business teams to interact with their customers.


Chatbots are conversational agents that leverage machine learning and natural language processing to understand intent in order to reply with appropriate answers, and they have advantages relevant to the present crisis.1-3 First, they are accessible any time, allowing patients to obtain answers 24/7 and to avoid wait times on hold before reaching a human. Second, chatbots have a higher handling capacity than any human.4 A single chat bot can simultaneously have conversations with thousands of people no matter what time of day. Regardless of the volume of calls, every question may be answered immediately.
